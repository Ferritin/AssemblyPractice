# AssemblyPractice
Various assembly scripts I wrote while trying to learn x86 assembly on Linux.

These come from the examples and the exercises of the book "Programming from the Ground Up" by Jonathan Bartlett.

Note: To run these, I just used the regular assembler that comes with Ubuntu, included are also some shell scripts that assemble and link the code together.
